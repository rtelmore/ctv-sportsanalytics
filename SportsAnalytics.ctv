      This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages useful for
      sports analytics, grouped by sport. 
      Following the list of packages, we've included a list of selected books and articles
      that use some of these packages in substantive ways. 
      Our goal in compiling this list is to help researchers find the tools they
      need to complete their work in R. 
    </p>

    <p> 
      The list of packages is aspirationally comprehensive.
      If there is a sports analytics package on CRAN that we have missed, please let us know. 
      Contributions are always welcome, and encouraged. 
      The source file for this particular task view file
      resides in a GitHub repository (see below). 
      Please read the <a href="Contributing.md">Guide to Contributing</a>, then open an issue and/or submit a pull request.
